# PythonWork
Samples of python projects from roughly 2017 to 2020. I have seperated them into projects from while I was in 
highschool and projects from while I've been in college.

I also have repositories for my Lua work and my Game Maker Language (a loosely C++ based language) work. You can
find them at https://github.com/ConnorMcKinney
