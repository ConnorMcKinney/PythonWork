This was my very first experience in writing any sort of networking programs and in trying multithreading. The
implementation is crude and only works over LAN, but I'm still proud of the research I did and effort I put into
the project.

This was done as a proof of concept for a LAN multiplayer maze racing game. Unfortunately, the teacher of my class
decided against having the final project be group work.
