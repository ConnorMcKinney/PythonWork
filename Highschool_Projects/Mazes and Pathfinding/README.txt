I've been interested in mazes and pathfinding since around the age of 14. While I did most of my exploration
of the topic in a game development environment called Roblox with the Lua language, I did a simple implementation
in python for a group work project that ended up being canceled by the teacher.

The Lua work can be found at https://github.com/ConnorMcKinney/LuaWork

This program randomly generates a maze of any (reasonable) given size and seed and brute forces a solution to
maze to determine whether it can be solved.
