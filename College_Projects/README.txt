Grocery Adventure and Penguin Pacer are both projects from my ENG 101 class in college. Grocery Adventure has its
own README and Penguin Pacer has a .docx file that explains the project, how to play, and what the major features
of the project are.

The War Analysis project started out as a project for ENG 101. It was originally a fully automated game of war, 
but some time later while playing a real game of war with a friend I became curious about how long the "average" 
game of war takes. Cue a programming montage and some mildly interesting statistics. 

In case you're curious, based on 100,000 games of war, the average game lasts 146 turns, the longest game was 582 
turns, and the shortest game was only 10 turns.
