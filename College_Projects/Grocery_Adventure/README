This is a project from my college ENG 101 course at UAH. 

The goal of the project was to create a grocery store interface that read information from a text file (grocery_catalog in the folder Text_files) to populate the shelves,
had a shopping cart for customers to place items in, and could ring up customers according to what they put in their carts. Additionally, it would keep track of inventory
and would write to another output file when an item ran out.

I went for some extra credit by making the project more interesting. "More interesting" to me equated to an awful lot of flavor text, much of it being randomized from a list
of choices. I also added a randomized aisle system that refreshes once all item options have been viewed. Users can request an item that is not in their aisle if they know
the name of the item.
